# graph-algorithms
Test implementations of graph algorithms from Skeina's Algorithm Design Manual - mainly a learning aid for myself, to make sure I've understood the algorithm.

# Setup
Clone the repo, then from the top-level directory:
```ruby gem install bundler; bundle install

# Tests
Tests are written using rspec, all in the rspec directory. To run:

```ruby rspec

or for an explicit list of all tests in documentation format:
```ruby rspec --format=doc
